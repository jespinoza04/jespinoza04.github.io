## Favorite Labs & Reflections

### Lab 7 – Counties
**What I liked:**  
This lab was pretty chill. I liked working with the county data because it finally made vectors feel less confusing. It was kind of cool seeing how the populations added up and actually getting the right numbers.

**What I learned:**  
I learned how to loop through a 2D vector, use `stoi()`, and search for a specific county. It made a lot more sense after this lab.

### Lab 8 – Pattern Printer  
**What I liked:**  
I liked this lab because once the loops were right, the pattern showed up perfectly. It felt like solving a little puzzle and seeing it printed out made it satisfying.

**What I learned:**  
I got way better with nested loops and understanding how the counters change the output. It also helped me not overthink simple loop logic.

### Lab 9 – State Class / Hi-Lo Game  
**What I liked:**  
This one felt more like a “real” program. Using classes and getters made everything feel more organized, and it finally clicked how `.h` and `.cc` files work together.

**What I learned:**  
I learned how to work with classes, write return statements correctly, and follow the TODOs without overcomplicating things. It helped me understand object-oriented stuff a lot better.
